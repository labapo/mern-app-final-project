Introduction: A paragraph used to introduce interested parties to the project and needs to include one or more screenshots.

My application is called Social Contact. It's an app where users can put in all the social media sites and other contact information so we can all keep in touch.

Users will input the URLs for each social media platform, and when users view profiles, all they have to do is click on the button to get a hyperlink of their page. 

Here is what I planned the main page to look like:
